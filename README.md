# Price_Prediction_Automobile
A simple data science project to perform data preprocessing, data wrangling, correlation analysis, and build a predictive model using linear regression on different attributes to evaluate the effect of correlation.
## Things I learned/revised:
* Data cleaning
* Data Wrangling
* Data Correlation Analysis
* Linear Regression Predictive modelling after correlation analysis
* Model Evaluation through evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R-Squared Error
## Afterthoughts on the project:
Prior to the project, I did a similar projects to this in which I also had to perform preprocessing of data, analyze correlation of attributes and build a machine learning model. Thus, this particular project serves as a revision for me to further 
practice/refine my data science/analytics skills.
